## An Advanced Terminal Based Scientific Calculator made with Python

Most calculator apps are GUI based so I thought I'd make one in the terminal with curses and python.

### How to use

Just type in your equation and it will be spit out above the line. It also supports many different functions including trigonometric and other utility functions
